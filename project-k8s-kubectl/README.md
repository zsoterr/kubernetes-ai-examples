# project-k8s-kubectl
Increase kubectl's  efficiently with AI capabilities

## What is it and why?
In this project, I will show you how to use capabilites of AI with kubectl in linux CLI, through a real-world examples. 
The goal is to:
-  provide you with practical examples if you are interested in Kubernetes cluster management from CLI with AI integration,
-  give you with clear instructions on how to set up the environment and how you can use it to further develop it in your own environment


## Key features
- Technologies used: `Kubernetes v1.3x`, `Python 3.xx`,
- Architecture: `<NA> …`
- Important files & folders:
  - `main.py` – entry point from Python  
  - `index.html` – GUI / web interface 
  - `README.md` – this file  
- License: **MIT License** – see `LICENSE` file in the parent folder

## Usage
1. Pre-Requisites:
2. Configuation:
3. Start
4. WebInterface
5. Exit

## Not, comments
-This is the first version (v1), the goal was to have a working "demo" version: very basic, but I think it demonstrates well what it can be used for and how.
-It runs under Linux (I have validated it on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.), on the local machine where the kubectl-ai program is installed. (not remote but you can use it remotely with ssh tunelling).
-It has a search function: you can search the outputs, it "remembers" the last 20 commands and outputs, you can copy the command generated by the AI and use (refine) it later if needed.
-single-user environment, no permission management, no database
It's really just a PoC, using an openai API with a test kubernetes cluster.

## Planned changes in the near future:
- Add other providers as an "optional" option.
- Run as pod in the Kubernetes cluster
