## What is it and why?
In this project, I will show you how to use Kubernetes/EKS with capabilities of AI through a real-world example. 
The goal is to:
-  provide you with practical examples if you are interested in Kubernetes-AI integration
-  give you a learning foundation that you can further develop in your own environment
-  introduce proven solutions that I also use occasionally in my <other> projects

## Key features
- Technologies used: `Kubernetes v1.33`, `Python 3`, `Terraform`, `Helm`
- Architecture: will be documented when the first project is fully ready.

- License: **MIT License** – see `LICENSE` file. The license applies to the entire repo.
